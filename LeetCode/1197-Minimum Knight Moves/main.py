"""  
In an infinite chess board with coordinates from -infinity to +infinity, you have a knight at square [0, 0].

A knight has 8 possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. 
Each move is two squares in a cardinal direction, then one square in an orthogonal direction.

Return the minimum number of steps needed to move the knight to the square [x, y].  
It is guaranteed the answer exists.

Example 1:

Input: x = 2, y = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: [0, 0] â†’ [2, 1]
