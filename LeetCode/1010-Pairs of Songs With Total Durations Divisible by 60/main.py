"""  
In a list of songs, the i-th song has a duration of time[i] seconds. 

Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by 60.  
Formally, we want the number of indices i, j such that i < j with (time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0.


Example 1:

Input: [30,20,150,100,40]
Output: 3
Explanation: Three pairs have a total duration divisible by 60:
(time[0] = 30, time[2] = 150): total duration 180
(time[1] = 20, time[3] = 100): total duration 120
(time[1] = 20, time[4] = 40): total duration 60
"""


class Solution:
    """  
    two sum with K = 60

    Let theOther be in the pair with t, then

    (t + theOther) % 60 == 0

    so we have:

    t % 60 + theOther % 60 = 0 or 60
    then

    theOther % 60 = t % 60 = 0 
    or
    theOther % 60 = 60 - t % 60

    Note that it is possible that t % 60 == 0, which results 60 - t % 60 == 60,

    therefore, we should have

    theOther % 60 = (60 - t % 60) % 60
    Let 0 <= theOther < 60, therefore thOther = theOther % 60.
    use theOther to replace theOther % 60, we get

    theOther = (60 - t % 60) % 60;
